<p>My HTML notes </p>

<p>What is a markup? </p>

<p>A markup is when you <mark>add the ability</mark> to change the way a font
is displayed, <sub>whether it is in italics or in bold.</sub></p>

<p>I just learned the concept of ordered and unordered listing.
I will provide example lists for learning purposes. </p>

<h4> Things I like to do in my free time: </h4>

<ul>
  <li> play chess
    <li> read self-improvement books
      <li> play video games
        <li> learn self-defense
          </ul>

<h4> My mornings are pretty consistent: </h4>

<ol>
  <li> Once I get up, the first thing I do is make myself coffee.
    <li> Then I walk back to my room with the coffee in my hand and turn on my computer.
      <li> After turning on my computer, I get started either taking online courses or read news
        regarding my stock investments.
        </ol>

<p> <h4>I also learned that the following have optional closing tags:</h4></p>

<ul>
  <li> the paragraph element < p > (even though I prefer using the closing tag)
    <li> the list element < li > (I don't use the closing tag for this one)
      </ul>
