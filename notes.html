<p>What is a markup? </p>

<p>A markup is when you <mark>add the ability</mark> to change the way a font
is displayed, <sub>whether it is in italics or in bold.</sub></p>

<h4> Things I like to do in my free time: </h4>

<ul>
  <li> play chess
  <li> read self-improvement books
  <li> play video games
  <li> learn self-defense
</ul>

<h4> My mornings are pretty consistent: </h4>

<ol>
  <li> Once I get up, the first thing I do is make myself coffee.
  <li> Then I walk back to my room with the coffee in my hand and turn on my computer.
  <li> After turning on my computer, I get started either taking online courses or read news
        regarding my stock investments.
</ol>

<h4>I also learned that the following have optional closing tags:</h4>

<ul>
  <li> the paragraph element < p > (even though I prefer using the closing tag)
  <li> the list element < li > (I don't use the closing tag for this one)
</ul>

<h3 class="center"; style="color:blue;"> Nested List exercise </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mammals
      <ol>
        <li>Raccoons
        <li>Gorrillas
      </ol> <br>
    <li>Reptiles
      <ol>
        <li>Iguanas
        <li>Cobras
      </ol> <br>
    <li>Birds
        <ol>
          <li>Ostriches
          <li>Ravens
        </ol> <br>
</ul>

<h3> Linking a website </h3>

<p> Here is a link to my instagram account where I like to showcase my creative skills.
Please click on the link <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/zhengdesigns/" > My Instagram Account
</a>.

<h3> Displaying image and linking an image </h3>

<p> Here is a picture of bears. This image came from another website.
Notice the width and height are not the same because I wanted the image to be smaller in the notes, but
the source where the image is will show the original size.</p>

<a href="https://placebear.com/800/600">
  <img src="https://placebear.com/500/300"; class="resize imgcenter";
  alt = "Bears on a mountain">
</a> <br><br>

<p> Now I will display an image that comes from my own local computer (this means
  someone outside of my desktop will not be able to see this image). <br><br>
  *Note: I had to add this image in the same folder as the notes.html
  so that others can download this as a package and get the same result.*</p>

<h3> Adding style to this page </h3>

<p> To add style to this page, first make sure you place <strong>< style > < /style ></strong> in the
  head section. Here are some of the following styles I applied to this page: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>bolded text with <span style="color: green;">[font-weight: bold;]</span>

    <li>wanted to make a title specifically font sized in 30pt <span style="color:green;">[font-size: 30pt;]</span>

    <li>changed text color to green with <span style="color:green;">[color: green;]</span>

    <li>underlined text with <span style="color:green;">[text-decoration: underline;]</span>

    <li>created a class to center whatever I choose [.center] with <span style="color:green;">[text-align: center;]</span> <mark>(separate style element)</mark>

    <li>centered my main title and Nest List exercise, one example:
      <span style="color:green;">< h1 class = "center" > My Notes by Nicole Zheng < / h1 > </span> <mark>(inline style attribute)</mark>

    <li>added a margin around the whole page by making body as a selector in the style
       with <span style="color:green;">[margin:50px;]</span>

    <li> made a title colored blue in the same line as an already existing attribute for example
      <span style="color:green;">[< h3 class = "center" ; style = "color : blue ; " > Nest List exercise < / h3 >]</span> <mark>(inline style attribute) </mark>

    <li> use the <strong>< span > < / span > </strong> element to specifically
      color a word in a sentence green <span style="color:green;">
        [ < span style = "color: green"> WORD < /span >] </span>

    <li> added classes to make images sized at a specific width and height and centered
      <span style="color: green">[.resize][.imgcenter]</span>

  </ul>

<p>Important Note: there is another selector type [ID] with the [#] sign. You would treat
  this the same as the [class] with the [.] sign.</p>

<h3>Learning about Units</h3>

<p> When it comes to the resolution of a screen, there are some measurements to know: </p>

 <ul>
   <li>1 inch = 96 pixels
   <li>1 cm = 37.8 pixels
   <li>1 inch = 72 pt
   <li>1em = 12 pt (equal to the font size of the text in the element; great for determining what size the text is)
 </ul>

 <h3>Boxes</h3>
