<p>What is a markup? </p>

<p>A markup is when you <mark>add the ability</mark> to change the way a font
is displayed, <sub>whether it is in italics or in bold.</sub></p>

<p>I just learned the concept of ordered and unordered listing.
I will provide example lists for learning purposes. </p>

<h4> Things I like to do in my free time: </h4>

<ul>
  <li> play chess
  <li> read self-improvement books
  <li> play video games
  <li> learn self-defense
</ul>

<h4> My mornings are pretty consistent: </h4>

<ol>
  <li> Once I get up, the first thing I do is make myself coffee.
  <li> Then I walk back to my room with the coffee in my hand and turn on my computer.
  <li> After turning on my computer, I get started either taking online courses or read news
        regarding my stock investments.
</ol>

<h4>I also learned that the following have optional closing tags:</h4>

<ul>
  <li> the paragraph element < p > (even though I prefer using the closing tag)
  <li> the list element < li > (I don't use the closing tag for this one)
</ul>

<h3> Nested List exercise </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mammals
      <ol>
        <li>Raccoons
        <li>Gorrillas
      </ol> <br>
    <li>Reptiles
      <ol>
        <li>Iguanas
        <li>Cobras
      </ol> <br>
    <li>Birds
        <ol>
          <li>Ostriches
          <li>Ravens
        </ol> <br>
</ul>

<h3> Linking a website </h3>

<p> Here is a link to my instagram account where I like to showcase my creative skills.
Please click on the link <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/zhengdesigns/" > My Instagram Account
</a>.

<h3> Displaying image and linking an image </h3>

<p> Here is a picture of bears. This image came from another website.
Notice the width and height are not the same because I wanted the image to be smaller in the notes, but
the source where the image is will show the original size.</p>

<a href="https://placebear.com/800/600">
  <img src="https://placebear.com/500/300"
  alt = "Bears on a mountain">
</a> <br><br>

<p> Now I will display an image that comes from my own local computer (this means
  someone outside of my desktop will not be able to see this image). <br><br>
  *Note: I had to add this image in the same folder as the notes.html.*</p>
