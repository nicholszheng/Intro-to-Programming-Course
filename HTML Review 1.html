<p>I will be using a short story called <em>"A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed"</em> I found online
to apply the elements I just learned.</p>

<p><strong><h1>A friend in need is a friend indeed.</h1></strong></p>

<p><sup><strong>Once</strong></sup> upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a <sub>heavy</sub> meal,
it was sleeping under a tree.</p>

<p>After a while, there came a mouse and it started to play on the lion.
Suddenly the lion got up with <strong>anger</strong> and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep.
Then it saw a small mouse standing <em>trembling with fear</em>.</p>

<p>As the lion prepared to attack, the mouse requested the lion to forgive it.
The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away.</p>

<p>On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came and cut the net, allowing the lion to escape. <mark>Thereafter, the mouse and the lion became friends</mark>.</p>

<p>They lived happily in the forest afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Moral of the story: <em>A friend in need is a friend indeed</em>.</strong> </p> <br>
